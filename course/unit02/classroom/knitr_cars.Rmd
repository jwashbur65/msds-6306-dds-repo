<!--
Note to you, the student:
This is already in RMarkdown, so it should be easy to implement in your overall HW RMarkdown file.
You only need to include the TODOs for HW submission, but keep in mind that you might need other code to create objects the TODO uses!
-->

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r cars_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Including Plots
```{r pressure_data}
summary(pressure)
```

You can also embed plots as default, for example:
<!--
TODO: Assignment 2: 3A, complete the following scatter plot. 
The x axis is pressure, while the y axis is temperature
Please title the graph "Temperature vs Pressure"
-->
```{r pressure_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, )
```

Now flip it!

<!--
TODO: Assignment 2: 3B, complete the following scatter plot:
x axis is pressure, y axis is temperature,
Label the x axis as "Pressure" and the y axis as "Temperature", 
Title the graph as "Pressure vs Temperature"
-->

```{r pressure_plot2, echo=FALSE}
plot()
```
